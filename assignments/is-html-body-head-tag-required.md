## Is it necessary to write HEAD, BODY and HTML tags?

It is not compulsory to use head, body or html tags and can be ommited because HTML5 is not an extremely strict language. Only in HTML4 it couldnt be ommited. Infact its been observed that chrome and other browsers have automatically inserted the missing tags in the DOM (Document Object Model). But not ommiting the tags can be advantageous as listed below.

- Using the tags creates an advantage of clear structure seperating content in the html document.
- It also allows you to use those tags as css selectors for detailed styling when required.
- Head tags allows you to seperate meta information that is not visible and only for the browsers to run from visible content.
