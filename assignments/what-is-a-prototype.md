## What is a prototype?

Prototype is early working example of a product, website, application etc. Its used to test and improve the given product through brainstorming and collaboration before its released for production. Its a crucial step in design process that allows creators to identify issues, defects and solution to it saving them a lot of investment and time at releasing stage.

### There are different levels to prototype

- Low fidelity prototype often made of paper, sticky notes and sketches and is inexpensive to create
- Medium fidelity prototype also called wireframes with bare minimum details that allows a user to see underlying structure
- High fidelity prototype which add to the wireframe as much as detail as possible like visual design, content and even interaction
